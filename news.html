      <h4>Wayanad (Malayalam: [ʋɐjɐnaːɖɨ̆]) is a district in the north-east of the Indian state of Kerala, with administrative headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta. It is the only plateau in Kerala.[7] The Wayanad Plateau forms a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, the southern portion of Deccan Plateau. It is set high in the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2,100 meters.[8] Vellari Mala, a 2,240 m (7,349 ft) high peak situated on the trijunction of Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts, is the highest point in Wayanad district. The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in Kerala, by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. An area of 885.92 km2 in the district is forested.[9] Wayanad has three municipal towns—Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. There are many indigenous tribes in this area.[10][11] The Kabini River, a tributary of Kaveri River, originates at Wayanad. Wayanad district, along with the Chaliyar valley in the neighbouring Nilambur (Eastern Eranad region) in Malappuram district, is known for natural gold fields,[12] which are also seen in other parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Chaliyar river, which is the fourth longest river of Kerala, originates on the Wayanad plateau. The historically important Edakkal Caves are located in Wayanad district.

        Wayanad district is bordered by Karnataka (Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Mysore districts) to the north and north-east, Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris district) to the south-east (it is the only district that shares border with both the neighbouring states of Kerala), Malappuram to the south, Kozhikode to the south-west and Kannur to the north-west.[13] Pulpally in Wayanad boasts the only Lava-Kusha temple in Kerala and Vythiri has the only mirror temple in Kerala, which is a Jain temple. Varambetta mosque is the oldest Muslim mosque of Wayanad. Wayanad is famous for its role in the Cotiote War, where Pazhassi Raja with the help of the Kurichya tribe in association with Hindus and Muslims of the Malabar region launched a revolt against the British. Kaniyambetta and Muttil Panchayaths are the centrally located Panchayaths with the best access from all corners of Wayanad, while Tavinjal Panchayath is on the northeast border with Kannur district. The edicts found in the caves of Ambukuthi Mala are evidence that occupation dates from the beginning of the New Age Civilisation</h4>

      <h4>Relief and rescue operations are in full swing in the flood-affected Samej village near Rampur in Shimla district, as Himachal Pradesh grapples with the aftermath of catastrophic cloudbursts that have ravaged various parts of the state.

        The recent cloudburst has caused widespread destruction across the hill station, with Samej village being one of the hardest-hit areas. The disaster’s impact continues to be felt, as the Lahaul Spiti Police reported a flash flood near Zinzing Bar on National Highway 3, leading to road blockages and traffic halts at Sarcha and Sarch.
        
        In a positive development, the Kullu-Manali Highway, which was washed away on August 1, has partially reopened for one-way traffic. Kullu Deputy Commissioner Torul S Ravish said that while the National Highway suffered extensive damage, it has been restored for single-lane use. The Nirmand area reportedly faced the most significant losses, with 20 bridges washed away in Bagipul and nearby regions.
        
        The human toll of this disaster is becoming increasingly apparent. Himachal Pradesh Minister Vikramaditya Singh said, “A cloudburst occurred 2-3 days back over the Shrikhand mountain top. Due to this, areas in Rampur and Kullu have faced massive destruction.
        
        CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu also visited the area. He took stock of the situation and briefed the officials. We have started setting up Bailey bridges at various locations. Police personnel are being deployed at various places. The administration is coordinating with everyone. NDRF, SDRF, State Police, and Home Guard jawans are carrying out rescue operations together.”
        
        The state government has announced an immediate relief of Rs 50,000 for affected families, with promises of further compensation in the future.
        
        Earlier, the Indian Army launched extensive Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations to aid the affected communities in Himachal Pradesh’s Samej village.
        
        According to the Indian Army, the road to the incident site was blocked due to a land shift approximately 2.5 kilometres short of the incident site, after which troops moved on foot beyond the blockade.</h4>

      <h4>Dindigul Dragons lifted their maiden Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) title after 6-wicket victory over defending champions Lyca Kovai Kings in the summit clash of TNPL 2024 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Sunday (August 4).After an all-round bowling effort helped restrict Lyca Kovai Kings to 129/7 in their allotted 20 overs, skipper Ravichandran Ashwin scored a 46-ball 52 to guide Dindigul Dragons to a win with 10 balls to spare in the final.
        Baba Indrajith (32 off 35 balls) and C Sharath Kumar (27* off 15 balls) made vital contributions with bat in the Dragons' chase. For Lyca Kovai Kings, Gowtham Thamarai Kannan, Manimaran Siddharth, Valliappan Yudheeswaran and captain Shahrukh Khan chipped in with a wicket each.

Earlier, put in to bat, LKK got off to a decent start with Suresh Kumar racing to 22 off 11 balls, but Varun Chakravarthy (2 for 26) and Sandeep Warrier (2 for 26) put the brakes on the scoring early before Ashwin (0/13) and P Vignesh (2/15) bowled very tight spells.
The former Indian cricketer and T20 World Cup-winning coach, Rahul Dravid was the chief guest at the Shriram Capital TNPL 2024 final ceremony. The former captain spoke about how Chennai has given him some memorable moments.

"Chennai has given me several unforgettable moments. I reached my 10,000th run in Test cricket against South Africa at this very venue, and I have had many memorable experiences playing in Division cricket here," Dravid said.

"TNPL has undoubtedly provided a vital platform for young talent and has uncovered numerous players who have gone on to make a significant impact in Indian cricket."

TNPL, a T20 tournament organized by Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA), has been held every year since 2016 except for the year 2020 when the league was cancelled due to the COVID 19 pandemic.

In the 8 editions held so far, Chepauk Super Gillies are the most successful side having won the title four times in 2021, 2019, 2017 and 2022, when they shared the title with LKK as rain washed out the final.

Lyca Kovai Kings are the next best side with two titles, winning in 2022 and 2023, while Dragons now join Siechem Madurai Panthers and defunct Tuti Patriots as the other winners.
